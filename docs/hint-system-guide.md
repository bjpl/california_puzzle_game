## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import HintSystem from '@/components/HintSystem';
import { useGameStore } from '@/stores/gameStore';

function GameComponent() {
  const { gameState, useHint } = useGameStore();

  const handleHintRequested = (type: HintType) => {
    const targetCounty = gameState.remainingCounties[0];
    useHint(type, targetCounty.id, false);
  };

  return (
    <HintSystem
      gameState={gameState}
      onHintRequested={handleHintRequested}
      onHintDismissed={() => {}}
    />
  );
}
```

### Configuration

The hint system can be configured through game settings:

```typescript
const hintSettings: HintConfiguration = {
  maxHintsPerLevel: 5,           // Maximum hints per level
  hintCooldownMs: 30000,         // 30 second cooldown between hints
  scorePenaltyPerHint: 50,       // Point penalty for using hints
  freeHintsAllowed: 2,           // Free hints before penalties
  autoSuggestThreshold: 3,       // Failed attempts before auto-suggest
  enableVisualIndicators: true,   // Show visual hint overlays
  enableEducationalHints: true    // Include educational content
};
```

### Custom Hint Generation

```typescript
import { generateHint, HintType } from '@/utils/hintEngine';

// Generate a specific hint type
const locationHint = generateHint(county, HintType.LOCATION, 0.5);

// Generate educational content
const educationalHint = generateEducationalHint(county, 0.8, EducationalTheme.HISTORY);
```

### Educational Hints
Rich learning content:
- Historical significance
- Geographic features

## Struggle Analysis

The system tracks player difficulty and adapts accordingly:

```typescript
interface StruggleData {
  countyId: string;
  attempts: number;           // Failed placement attempts
  lastAttemptAt: number;     // Timestamp of last attempt
  totalTimeSpent: number;    // Time spent on this county
  wrongPlacements: Position[]; // History of incorrect placements
  suggestedHints: HintType[]; // Previously suggested hints
}
```

### Analysis Triggers

- **3+ attempts**: Suggests location hint
- **30+ seconds**: Suggests shape or neighbor hints
- **Scattered placements**: Suggests neighbor hint
- **5+ attempts**: Suggests educational content
- **7+ attempts**: Suggests name hint as last resort

## Visual Hint Components

### HintVisualIndicators

Provides animated visual feedback on the game map:

```tsx
<HintVisualIndicators
  visualData={hint.visualData}
  hintType={hint.type}
  county={targetCounty}
  isActive={true}
  onAnimationComplete={() => {}}
/>
```

### Supported Visual Effects
