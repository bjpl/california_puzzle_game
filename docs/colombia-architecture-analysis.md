```

#### Component Responsibilities

**GameContainer** (Main Orchestrator)
- Manages DndContext for drag-and-drop operations
- Coordinates game flow and modal states
- Handles drag events (start, move, end, cancel)
- Error boundary implementation
- Layout management with maximized map view

**OptimizedColombiaMap** (Map Rendering Engine)
- D3-geo integration for geographic projections
- Progressive data loading (ultra-light → optimized)
- SVG-based map rendering with interactive features
- Zoom and pan functionality with mouse/touch support
- Region color visualization toggle
- Memoized path generation for performance

**DepartmentTray** (Interactive Pieces)
- Multiple layout modes (horizontal, vertical, compact, ultra-compact)
- Draggable department chips with region-based styling
- Filtering by game mode (respects regional selections)
- Accessibility features with ARIA labels

### 2. State Management Pattern

#### Zustand Store Architecture
The game uses Zustand for centralized state management with clear separation of concerns:

```typescript
interface GameState {
  // Core game state
  departments: Department[];
  placedDepartments: Set<string>;
  currentDepartment: Department | null;
  score: number;
  attempts: number;
  hints: number;

  // Timing and flow
  startTime: number | null;
  elapsedTime: number;
  isGameStarted: boolean;
  isGameComplete: boolean;

  // Regional mode support
  gameMode: GameModeConfig;
  activeDepartments: Department[];
  regionProgress: Map<string, RegionProgress>;

  // Actions (methods)
  placeDepartment: (id: string, correct: boolean) => void;
  selectDepartment: (department: Department) => void;
  resetGame: () => void;
  setGameMode: (mode: GameModeConfig) => void;
}
```

#### Key State Management Features
- **Immutable updates** with proper state transitions
- **Regional filtering** support for focused gameplay
- **Progress tracking** with persistent statistics
- **Timer integration** with pause/resume functionality
- **Modal state management** through custom hooks

### 3. Map Rendering Pipeline

#### D3-geo Integration
The map rendering uses a sophisticated D3-geo pipeline:

```typescript
// Projection setup
const projection = geoMercator()
  .center([-74, 4.5])  // Colombia center
  .scale(scale)
  .translate([width / 2, height / 2]);

const pathGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);
```

#### Progressive Loading Strategy
1. **Ultra-light data** (8KB) loads first for immediate rendering
2. **Optimized data** (110KB) replaces for detailed geography
3. **Fallback mechanisms** handle network failures gracefully

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized path strings** prevent recalculation on re-renders
- **Component memoization** for department paths
- **Viewport-based scaling** for responsive design
- **Transform-based zoom/pan** for smooth interactions

### 4. Drag-and-Drop Implementation

#### DND Kit Integration
The game uses @dnd-kit/core for modern, accessible drag-and-drop:

```typescript
<DndContext
  onDragStart={handleDragStart}
  onDragMove={handleDragMove}
  onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
  collisionDetection={rectIntersection}
  autoScroll={{ enabled: true, threshold: { x: 0.2, y: 0.2 } }}
>
```

#### Drag Flow Management
1. **Drag Start**: Department selection and visual feedback
2. **Drag Move**: Distance tracking to differentiate clicks from drags
3. **Drag End**: Placement validation and scoring
4. **Drag Cancel**: Escape key handling and cleanup

#### Accessibility Features
- Screen reader announcements for drag states
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements
- Focus management during modal transitions

### 5. Game Logic and Scoring System

#### Scoring Mechanics
```typescript
// Correct placement scoring
const newScore = state.score + Math.max(100 - state.attempts * 10, 10);

// Hint penalty
hints: Math.max(0, state.hints - 1),
score: Math.max(0, state.score - 50)
```

#### Game Completion Logic
- **Dynamic completion** based on active departments (regional mode support)
- **Attempt tracking** per department with retry logic
- **Hint system** with score penalties
- **Time tracking** with pause/resume functionality

#### Progression System
- **Regional unlocking** based on performance
- **Star ratings** (1-3 stars) based on time and accuracy
- **Best time tracking** per region
- **Statistics persistence** across sessions

### 6. Educational Features

#### Study Mode Architecture
The study mode provides comprehensive learning tools:

**Interactive Department Explorer**
- Multiple view modes (cards, grid, map)
- Region-based filtering and focus
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Smart recommendations based on study patterns

**Information Display System**
- Geographic data (area, population, coordinates)
- Cultural trivia and interesting facts
- Memory aids and learning techniques
- Regional context and relationships

**Progressive Learning Flow**
```typescript
interface StudyFlowState {
  phase: 'explore' | 'focus' | 'quiz' | 'ready';
  studiedDepartments: Set<string>;
  focusedRegion: string | null;
  quizCorrect: number;
  quizTotal: number;
}
```

#### Tutorial System
- **Interactive tutorials** with step-by-step guidance
- **First-time user detection** with automatic tutorial trigger
- **Skip functionality** for experienced users
- **Context-sensitive help** throughout the application

### 7. Data Structures

#### Department Interface
```typescript
interface Department {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  name: string;            // Display name
  capital: string;         // Capital city
  area: number;            // Area in km²
  population: number;      // Population count
  region: string;          // Regional classification
  trivia: string;          // Educational content
  coordinates: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  };
}
```

#### Regional Organization
Colombia is organized into 6 distinct regions:
- **Insular** (1 department) - Islands
- **Pacífico** (4 departments) - Pacific coast
- **Orinoquía** (4 departments) - Eastern plains
- **Amazonía** (6 departments) - Amazon rainforest
- **Caribe** (8 departments) - Caribbean coast
- **Andina** (10 departments) - Andean mountains

### 8. Performance Considerations

#### Rendering Optimizations
- **Memoized components** prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Virtual scrolling** for large department lists
- **Progressive image loading** for map data
- **Transform-based animations** for smooth interactions

#### Memory Management
- **Set-based collections** for efficient lookups
- **Map-based storage** for regional progress
- **Cleanup on unmount** to prevent memory leaks
- **Debounced interactions** to reduce event frequency

#### Network Optimization
- **Chunked data loading** with fallbacks
- **Compression** for geographic data
- **Caching strategies** for repeated requests
- **Offline capability** considerations
