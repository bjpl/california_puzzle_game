# County Formation Animation - Technical Documentation

## Overview
The County Formation Animation is an interactive educational feature that visualizes California's 58 counties appearing chronologically from 1850-1907, telling the story of the state's geographic and political development.

**Note**: This is distinct from the "Timeline" tab in Study Mode, which provides chronological browsing. This component focuses on animated visualization of county creation.

## üíª Technical Architecture

### State Management
```typescript
interface AnimationState {
  currentYear: number;              // 1850-1907
  isPlaying: boolean;               // Animation active
  playbackSpeed: 0.5|1|2|5;        // Speed multiplier
  visibleCounties: Set<string>;    // Counties founded so far
  recentlyAdded: string[];         // Counties added this year
  highlightedCounty: string|null;  // Currently hovered/featured
  hasStarted: boolean;             // Intro screen dismissed
}
```

### Animation Loop
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isPlaying) return;

  const animate = () => {
    const yearDuration = 1000 / playbackSpeed; // ms per year

    if (deltaTime >= yearDuration) {
      setCurrentYear(prev => prev + 1);
      addCountiesForYear(nextYear);
    }

    animationFrameRef.current = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  };

  // ... cleanup
}, [isPlaying, playbackSpeed]);
```

### Performance Optimizations
1. **requestAnimationFrame** - Smooth 60fps animations
2. **useMemo** - Cached county-by-year grouping
3. **CSS Transitions** - Hardware-accelerated opacity/stroke changes
4. **Set Data Structure** - O(1) visibility lookups
