- Provide text alternatives for critical information

### Consistency Rules

2. **Educational content**: Use 📚 for study, 💡 for hints
3. **Achievements**: Use ⭐ for standard, 🏆 for ultimate
4. **Feedback**: Use ✅ for success, ❌ for errors
5. **Navigation**: Prefer SVG icons over emojis for controls

### Performance Notes
- Emojis render differently across operating systems
- Consider using SVG alternatives for critical UI elements
- Limit decorative emoji use to improve load times

## Future Considerations

### Potential Additions
